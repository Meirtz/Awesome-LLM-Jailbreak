### 1. [SciSafeEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Safety Alignment of Large Language Models in Scientific Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03769)

**Summary**: The paper introduces SciSafeEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) in scientific tasks across various domains and representations, including molecular, protein, and genomic languages. The benchmark includes zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought evaluations, along with a 'jailbreak' feature to test LLMs' defenses against malicious intent, aiming to promote responsible development and deployment of LLMs in scientific research.

### 2. [Hidden in Plain Text: Emergence & Mitigation of Steganographic Collusion in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03768)

**Summary**: The paper explores the emergence of steganographic collusion in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrates that such collusion can arise indirectly from optimization pressures. The authors introduce two methods, gradient-based and in-context reinforcement learning, to elicit sophisticated steganographic communication in LLMs, finding that it can be robust to both passive and active mitigation efforts. The study emphasizes the need for innovative oversight techniques to effectively mitigate risks post-deployment.

### 3. [You Know What I'm Saying -- Jailbreak Attack via Implicit Reference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03857)

**Summary**: The paper introduces a novel vulnerability called Attack via Implicit Reference (AIR), which exploits context within nested harmless objectives to generate malicious content undetected by current large language models (LLMs). AIR achieves over 90% attack success rates across various state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4, Claude-3.5, and Qwen-2-72B, highlighting the need for improved defense mechanisms against contextual attacks.

### 4. [Chain-of-Jailbreak Attack for Image Generation Models via Editing Step by Step](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03869)

**Summary**: The paper introduces a novel jailbreaking method called Chain-of-Jailbreak (CoJ) attack, which exploits text-based image generation models by decomposing malicious queries into multiple sub-queries for iterative image editing, bypassing safety measures. The CoJ attack was found to be effective in over 60% of cases across various models, outperforming other methods. To counter this, the authors propose a defense mechanism called Think Twice Prompting, which successfully defends against 95% of CoJ attacks.

### 5. [Towards Secure Tuning: Mitigating Security Risks Arising from Benign Instruction Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04524)

**Summary**: The paper addresses security risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) after Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT), even when the tuning instructions are benign. The authors propose a novel IFT strategy called Modular Layer-wise Learning Rate (ML-LR), which differentiates learning rates for robust modules identified through a proxy-guided search algorithm. Experimental results show that this strategy effectively mitigates security risks without compromising the usability or expertise of the LLMs.

### 6. [A test suite of prompt injection attacks for LLM-based machine translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05047)

**Summary**: The paper introduces a comprehensive test suite for evaluating prompt injection attacks (PIAs) on LLM-based machine translation systems, extending previous work by Sun and Miceli-Barone. The suite covers all language pairs in the WMT 2024 General Machine Translation task and includes various attack formats to assess the robustness of these systems against malicious input interference.

### 7. [Harnessing Task Overload for Scalable Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04190)

**Summary**: The paper introduces a scalable jailbreak attack on Large Language Models (LLMs) that exploits resource constraints to bypass safety mechanisms. By engaging the LLM in a computationally intensive preliminary task, the attack saturates the model's processing capacity, preventing the activation of safety protocols when executing the target instruction. This method demonstrates high success rates across various LLMs and emphasizes the need for more robust safety measures that consider resource limitations.

### 8. [Suspiciousness of Adversarial Texts to Human](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04377)

**Summary**: The paper investigates the concept of human suspiciousness in adversarial texts, which differs from imperceptibility in images as texts must maintain semantic coherence while remaining undetected by human readers. The study introduces a novel dataset of human evaluations on the suspiciousness of adversarial sentences and develops a regression model to quantify and reduce this suspiciousness, providing a baseline for future research in adversarial text generation.

### 9. [Prompts have evil twins](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07064)

**Summary**: The paper introduces "evil twins," unintelligible prompts that elicit similar behavior in language models as their natural-language counterparts, despite being uninterpretable to humans. These prompts are shown to transfer across different models and are generated by solving a maximum-likelihood problem, which has broader applications in understanding and manipulating model behavior.

### 10. [Follow My Instruction and Spill the Beans: Scalable Data Extraction from Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17840)

**Summary**: The paper investigates the vulnerability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, particularly those using instruction-tuned Language Models (LMs), to datastore leakage through prompt injection. It demonstrates that adversaries can exploit these systems to extract verbatim text data, with the risk increasing as model size scales up. The study also shows that position bias elimination strategies can mitigate this vulnerability.

### 11. [Representation noising effectively prevents harmful fine-tuning on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14577)

**Summary**: The paper introduces Representation Noising (RepNoise), a defense mechanism against harmful fine-tuning attacks on large language models (LLMs). RepNoise removes information related to harmful representations, making it difficult for attackers to recover them during fine-tuning, even when they have access to the model weights. The method is shown to be effective across various harmful tasks and does not impair the model's performance on harmless tasks.

### 12. [Evaluating and Safeguarding the Adversarial Robustness of Retrieval-Based In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15984)

**Summary**: The paper investigates the robustness of Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning (ICL) methods against adversarial attacks, finding that while they improve robustness against test sample attacks, they are more vulnerable to demonstration attacks. The study introduces a training-free defense method, DARD, which enhances robustness by enriching the example pool with attacked samples, achieving a 15% reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR) compared to baselines.

### 13. [Understanding Jailbreak Success: A Study of Latent Space Dynamics in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09289)

**Summary**: The paper investigates the mechanisms behind jailbreaking in large language models, finding that a single jailbreak vector can mitigate different types of jailbreaks, suggesting a common internal mechanism. It also identifies a potential commonality in how effective jailbreaks reduce the model's perception of prompt harmfulness, providing insights for developing more robust countermeasures against jailbreaking.

### 14. [Revisiting Who's Harry Potter: Towards Targeted Unlearning from a Causal Intervention Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16997)

**Summary**: The paper revisits the Who's Harry Potter (WHP) method for Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning, proposing a new task of targeted unlearning where only specific information about a given target is removed from the model. It introduces a causal intervention framework to model the unlearning process, treating the target's knowledge as a confounder and the unlearning as a deconfounding process. The proposed approach demonstrates competitive performance in experiments without explicit optimization for specific criteria.

### 15. [Advancing Adversarial Suffix Transfer Learning on Aligned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14866)

**Summary**: The paper introduces DeGCG, a two-stage transfer learning framework for improving the efficiency of adversarial suffix generation in large language models (LLMs). By decoupling the search process into pre-searching and post-searching stages, DeGCG enhances suffix transferability across models and datasets. The interleaved variant, i-DeGCG, further accelerates the search process by leveraging self-transferability, achieving significant improvements in adversarial success rates (ASRs) on Llama2-chat-7b.

### 16. [Obliviate: Neutralizing Task-agnostic Backdoors within the Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14119)

**Summary**: The paper introduces Obliviate, a defense mechanism for neutralizing task-agnostic backdoors in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large language models. The proposed method, which amplifies benign neurons and penalizes trigger tokens, significantly reduces the success rate of state-of-the-art backdoor attacks by 83.6% across various PEFT architectures. Obliviate also demonstrates robust defense against both task-specific backdoors and adaptive attacks.

### 17. [Reconstruct Your Previous Conversations! Comprehensively Investigating Privacy Leakage Risks in Conversations with GPT Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02987)

**Summary**: The paper introduces a Conversation Reconstruction Attack that aims to extract private conversation content between users and GPT models through malicious prompts. Despite GPT-4's resilience, advanced attacks show significant privacy leakage across all models. The study underscores the vulnerability of GPT models to privacy breaches and calls for stronger safeguards.

### 18. [An Adversarial Perspective on Machine Unlearning for AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18025)

**Summary**: The paper examines the effectiveness of unlearning methods in removing hazardous capabilities from large language models, challenging the distinction between unlearning and traditional safety post-training. It demonstrates that existing jailbreak techniques can bypass unlearning protections when applied strategically and introduces adaptive methods that recover most unlearned capabilities, questioning the robustness of current unlearning approaches.

### 19. [Adversarial Suffixes May Be Features Too!](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00451)

**Summary**: The paper investigates the hypothesis that adversarial suffixes in large language models (LLMs) are not just vulnerabilities but may represent features that can dominate model behavior. Through experiments, the authors demonstrate that benign features can be transformed into adversarial suffixes that compromise safety alignment and that these features can be introduced through fine-tuning with benign datasets. The findings underscore the risk posed by benign features in training data and advocate for further research to enhance LLM safety.

### 20. [Automated Progressive Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03876)

**Summary**: The paper introduces Automated Progressive Red Teaming (APRT), a framework designed to identify vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) by automating the process of generating adversarial prompts. APRT uses three core modules—Intention Expanding LLM, Intention Hiding LLM, and Evil Maker—to progressively explore and exploit LLM weaknesses through multi-round interactions. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments, showing it can elicit unsafe but useful responses from various LLMs, including Meta's Llama-3-8B-Instruct, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.5.

### 21. [Jailbreak Antidote: Runtime Safety-Utility Balance via Sparse Representation Adjustment in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02298)

**Summary**: The paper introduces Jailbreak Antidote, a method for dynamically adjusting the safety-utility balance in large language models (LLMs) by manipulating a sparse subset of the model's internal states during inference. This approach allows for real-time control over safety preferences without increasing computational overhead or inference latency, and it is shown to be effective across a range of LLMs and against various jailbreak attacks.
